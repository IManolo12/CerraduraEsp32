## Project Description
In these project, the user would have to enter a numerical password in the **keypad matrix**, and then press the enter button.  
The **ESP32** is in charge of communicating with a database deployed in *Firebase*, and compare the entered pasword with the one in the database.  
If the password was right, then the user would have to use the **fingerprint reader**, if the fingerprint matches with the one saved in the database, the user is going to be able to open the door.  
The **ESP32** is going to do the same as before, but the comparison is made between the entered fingerprint and the one saved in the database.

<ins>The main components we used are:</ins>
- Fingerprint reader
- ESP32
- Keypad matrix

*This project was made for MAPE 2022*
